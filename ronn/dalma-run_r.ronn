## SYNOPSIS  

NYUAD HPC team provides a global R software environment which can be used through "Linux environment modules". However, we do not install additional R modules to the global environment.  So if you need, say the "coda" module, you will need to install it in your own environment.  

## DESCRIPTION  

### Install R Modules

1.- Login Dalma.

2.- (One time setup) Run this in terminal:

`$RECIPESDIR/localize-R.sh`

3.- Logout Dalma and login again.

4.- Now you should be able to install R packages locally. First you enter R. Run this in terminal:

`R`

Then, inside R:

`install.packages('coda',lib='~/R.local')`

The command above will install package `coda` to your local folder `~/R.local`, which is in the R search path. The general formula is:

`install.packages('<package-name>',lib='~/R.local')`

### Remove R Modules

In R, if you want to remove a package called coda:

`remove.packages('coda',lib='~/R.local')`

### Update R Modules

In R, if you want to update a package called coda:

`update.packages('coda',lib='~/R.local')`

### List R Modules

`installed.packages()`
