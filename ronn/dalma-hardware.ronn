## SYNOPSIS  

You want to know the system configuration of Dalma, in order to make the most out of it.

## DESCRIPTION  

The most important specification on compute node, are the number of cpus per node: 28, and memory per node: 128GB. Detailed configuration:

* 234 compute nodes
* Two Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 Broadwell CPUs per node
* 2 x 14 cores, 2.4 GHz
* No Hyperthreading
* AVX 2.0 ISA extension
* 128 GB Memory Per Node
* 6,552 CPU cores
* Mellanox EDR InfiniBand with non-blocking fat tree topology
* CentOS 7 Linux distribution
* Slurm batch system
* Support for OpenMP programming model for intra-node parallelization
* OpenMPI (Message Passing Interface) Implementation
* BeeGFS Parallel Filesystem for regular files
* Lustre Parallel Filesystem for large files


## EXPLANATION
A long list. So what does it mean?

* For parallel jobs, utilize the whole node (28 cores) to maximize the performance. E.g., set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` for hybrid or OpenMP jobs, or set the number of MPI ranks equals the number of nodes times 28 for pure MPI jobs.
* Use maximum 100GB of memory per node. If you need more, use fat node. Why not 128GB? We need to reserve memory for system itself and etc.
* For pre-compiled binaries, try `Centos` or `RHEL` version.
* Before generating tons of data, evaluate your storage requirements and select the most suitable file system.
