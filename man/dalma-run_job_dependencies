.TH "DALMA\-RUN_JOB_DEPENDENCIES" "" "November 2016" "NYUAD" "Dalma Manual"
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
You want to submit several jobs that have dependencies, to create a workflow\. E\.g\., Job B will only start after Job A is finished\. Job C will only start after Job B is finished\. And so on\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
SLURM provide powerful mechanism to define job dependencies, by the job submission command \fBsbatch \-d \fItype\fR:\fIid\fR\fR\. The keyword \fB\fIid\fR\fR could be job id or job array id\. There are 4 available \fB\fItype\fR\fR :
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBafterany\fR: This job could begin after specified jobs have terminated\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBafterok\fR: This job could begin after specified jobs have \fBsuccessfully\fR terminated (e\.g\., exit code zero)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBafternotok\fR: This job could begin after specified jobs have failed\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBafter\fR: This job could begin after specified jobs have begun\. \fB(e\.g\., if you use this keyword, and specify job2 depends on job1, job2 could start immediately once job1 starts!)\fR

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.
.SS "You want to submit a job that will start after another job is terminated"
Let say you first submitted a job\. You run this in terminal, and the job id shows in the screen\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf


sbatch job1\.sh
Submitted batch job 123456
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Then you have a second job\. You want to make sure the second job could only start running after the first job is successfully terminated\. You could run this in the terminal\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf


sbatch \-d afterok:123456 job2\.sh
or
sbatch \-\-dependency=afterok:123456 job2\.sh
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In this case, for example, if you cancel the first job, the first job will not be terminated sucessfully\. The second job will change its state to DependencyNeverSatisfied, and will not start running\.
.
.P
Alternatively, you could have the second job ready to start after the first job is terminated, whether sucessfully or not\. The command will be:
