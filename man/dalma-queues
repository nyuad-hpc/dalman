.SH "DESCRIPTION"
With new new scheduler SLURM, the concept of queue has changed\. Now queues are referred as \fIpartitions\fR
.
.P
There are only three partitions (queues): \'parallel\', \'serial\' and \'preempt\'
.
.P
With Slurm is possible to use the old \fIqsub\fR command (although compatibility is not 100% guaranteed) which means that some of the old queues could still work\. In this case they will be redirected to either \'serial\' or \'parallel\':

.P
Now there is no \'interactive\' queue anymore\. Interactive jobs can be started either in \'parallel\' or \'serial\'
.
.P
There is no more \'gpu\' or \'bigmem\' queues
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The correct way to select a partition (queue) is with the \fB\-p\fR option in the submission script:
.
.P
#SBATCH \-p parallel
.
.P
or
.
.P
#SBATCH \-p serial
.
.P
If the user has an old PBS script the following may still work:
.
.P
#PBS \-q p24
.
.P
But remember that in this case will be redirected to the partition \'parallel\'
